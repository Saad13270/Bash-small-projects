3- Bash Script Deep Dive Course
4- Complete Previous labs

1. Introduction

In this lab, we will implement a continuous deployment (CD) process using Bash, Docker, and AWS. The CD process allows us to automate the deployment of a Dockerized application from a repository to an AWS service (e.g., ECS - Elastic Container Service). We will also implement rollback strategies to handle deployment failures and ensure a smooth CD pipeline.

2. Script Implementation

Here's the Bash script that accomplishes the tasks:


#!/bin/bash

# Define variables for AWS ECS deployment
ecs_cluster_name="your_ecs_cluster_name"
ecs_service_name="your_ecs_service_name"
ecs_task_definition="your_ecs_task_definition"
aws_region="your_aws_region"

# Define Docker application details
docker_image="ubuntu:latest"

# Function to deploy the Docker application on AWS ECS
deploy_to_ecs() {
    echo "Deploying the application to AWS ECS..."
    
    # Update the ECS service with the new task definition
    aws ecs update-service \
        --cluster "$ecs_cluster_name" \
        --service "$ecs_service_name" \
        --region "$aws_region" \
        --task-definition "$ecs_task_definition"
}

# Function to rollback in case of deployment failure
rollback() {
    echo "Rolling back the deployment..."
    
    # Perform the rollback steps here (e.g., re-deploy the previous version)
    
    echo "Rollback completed."
}

# Main script workflow
main() {
    # Pull the Docker image from the repository
    docker pull "$docker_image"
    
    # Deploy the application to AWS ECS
    deploy_to_ecs
    
    # Check the deployment status
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Deployment successful."
    else
        echo "Deployment failed."
        # Implement rollback in case of failure
        rollback
    fi
}

# Call the main function to start the script
main


Explanation of the Script

We define variables for AWS ECS deployment, such as the ECS cluster name, service name, task definition, and AWS region.

We also specify the Docker image location in the docker_image variable.

The deploy_to_ecs function updates the ECS service with the new task definition, effectively deploying the Docker application.

In the rollback function, we can implement rollback steps (not specified here) in case of deployment failure.

The main function pulls the Docker image, deploys the application to AWS ECS, and checks the deployment status. If the deployment fails, it calls the rollback function to initiate the rollback process.

3. Running the Script

To run the script:

Save the script in a .sh file, e.g., cd_pipeline.sh.

Make the script executable by running chmod +x cd_pipeline.sh.

Execute the script by running ./cd_pipeline.sh.

The script will pull the Docker image, deploy the application to AWS ECS, and handle deployment failures by initiating the rollback process.

4. Conclusion

In this lab, we have demonstrated a continuous deployment (CD) process using Bash, Docker, and AWS. CD processes automate application deployment, making it efficient and reliable. The implementation of rollback strategies in case of deployment failures ensures that the system remains resilient and can quickly recover from unexpected issues, contributing to a robust CD pipeline.
